London  
London is the capital and 
most populous city of 
England and the United 
Kingdom. Standing on the 
River Thames in the south 
east of the island of Great 
Britain, London has been 
a major settlement for two 
millennia. It was founded 
by the Romans, who 
named it Londinium. 
London's ancient core, the 
City of London, largely 
retains its 1.12 -square -
mile medieval boundaries. 
Since at least the 19th century, London has also referred to the metropolis around this core, 
historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surre y, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely 
makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.
